Here I'm testing out using phaser in conjuction with ES6.

I'm using Josh Morony's repo for this (https://github.com/joshuamorony/phaser-es6-boilerplate).
I'm also following Josh Morony's tutorial (https://www.joshmorony.com/level-up-your-phaser-games-with-es6/).

This will be a copy of the tutorial-1 tutorial, perhaps with extra / different implementations, done in es6.
